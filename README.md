Animal movement detection in fields using ESP32 involves deploying the ESP32 microcontroller, which features built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, to monitor and report animal activity through various sensors such as PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors, ultrasonic sensors, and camera modules. The system, powered often by solar panels and rechargeable batteries, processes sensor data to detect movement, utilizing simple threshold detection or more sophisticated algorithms. Upon detecting movement, the ESP32 communicates this information to a central system or cloud server, enabling real-time monitoring and remote control via mobile apps or web dashboards. This technology finds applications in wildlife monitoring, livestock management, and intrusion detection, offering a cost-effective, scalable, and versatile solution for enhancing agricultural practices and ensuring animal safety. Despite challenges like power management and environmental factors, the ESP32-based system provides reliable, real-time data, aiding in quick decision-making and efficient field management.
